PURPOSE
========
The purpose of this script is to customize the application letter template, by replacing the job title(JB_TITLE) and workplace(WK_PLACE) variables in the letter.

PREREQUISITES
=============
To run the script you must have python and the python-docx module installed, this can be installed using pip.

pip install python-docx

USAGE
======
Before running the python script, open the document template and replace the [Enter your name here] placeholder with your name, it's best edited here as I created the script to be used by a single person in mind, and hence the name will remain constant accross application letters.

To run the script you must specify the positon being applied for using the "-p" option and optionally the organization you're applying to using the "-o" option e.g.

python application.py -p "Diabolical Ninja"

python application.py -p "Diabolical Ninja" -o "Rule the World Inc"

OTHER STUFF
===========
Feel free to edit, modify, improve or fork the script to your hearts content.
